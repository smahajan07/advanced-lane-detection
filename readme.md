## Work In Progress

## Overview

Lane detection is a critical component of the perception module for an autonomous vehicle. The objective of this module is to design and develop a lane detection algorithm which is robust and optimized. Autonomous driving is a complicated task and an interconnected web of modules running in tandem. Lane detection can further aid in motion planning and navigation and hence should provide realible data. 

For this project we will focus on the computer vision aspect of lane detection. A video feed of a car driving on a higway will be used, credits to dataset available for Udacity's Self Driving Car Nano Degree. Primary objective would be to detect lanes and then predict the turn based on the vaninshing point location.

The source code is in modern C++ and please raise an issue or request a PR if you wish to add features, recommend changes or report a bug. The build system used is Cmake in order to facilitate cross platform builds. The project also uses the OpenCV library as a dependency, so make sure it is installed before running the project and if not, please follow the provided instructions to do so.

## Installation

* Build and run demo and unit tests (Only if OpenCV is installed, else install OpenCV first by following the steps to install OpenCV)

```
git clone git@github.com:smahajan07/advanced-lane-detection.git
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build
cd build
wget -O project_video.mp4 "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EzhVEtTwcF3gLe1hh-ib2JnFaH31o0fS"
wget -O test.png "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=14rU9upKeVllUYNvmpL00W7s95JR8WNQH"
cmake ..
make
Run the demo: ./app/shell-app
```

* Steps to install OpenCV, if not installed already

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
sudo apt-get install -y cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev
git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
cd opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D WITH_TBB=ON -D WITH_V4L=ON -D WITH_QT=ON -D WITH_OPENGL=ON ..
make -j4
sudo make install
sudo /bin/bash -c 'echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf'
sudo ldconfig
cd ../../
```

## Doxygen Documentation

Doxygen generated documents can be viewed by:

```
cd <path to repository>
cd docs
Open in browser:  classlanedetector.html 
```

Follow the steps to generate doxygen documentation in HTML and LaTEX:

```
cd <path to repository>
mkdir <name of directory>
cd <name of directory>
doxygen -g <config file name> 
Edit config: nano <config file name>
Run: doxygen <config file name>
```

To view the documents, open the file in your browser.

## SIP (Solo Iterative Process)

A solo iterative process is characterized by a single programmer working alone.
SIP is current;y being used to manage this project. A product backlog, iteration backlog and work log and a defect log are being maintained and the progress can be tracked by the following spreadsheet. 

[Google Spread Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pAFY7_X_TjFaCiD-pRBMCMxe55UK4Ttg2dLJemnxAUg/edit?usp=sharing)

The project consists of two iterations, please find the details in the spreadsheet.
